## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

### Concept 1:

Plot the occurences of nuclear test data and include data from [Cesium-137](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2669354/files/1725248_287-294.pdf) 
and/or [Carbon-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_pulse).

### Concept 2:

Inspect detail of each test for each country; including things such as the mushroom cloud height and crater depth.
Draw the mushroom graphic according to size and scale of parameters.
Possibly focus on the [largest explosions](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/tests/multimegtests.html).


### Concept 3:

Explore a more complex task of the [nuclear arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race) of testing together with delivery systems; 
the [bomber gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_gap) and  [missile gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_gap).
