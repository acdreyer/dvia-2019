Stones unturned: Project 3: Mapping earthquake data onto a map

This section relates to the concepts of showing non-spatial data before applying it to
the spatial map.

-------------------------

### Concept 1:

The first concept relies on conveying the information of earthquake depth and/or magnitude
through the retinal variable of shape and size directly onto the map.
The idea is to create an icon that will show the value type through a visual 
language related to earthquakes (i.e. a crack in the ground or a vibration wave.)

### Concept 2:

The 2nd concept is to show the depth and depth uncertainty values over time by using the retinal
variables of position and length respectively. For this purpose a bar will be 
drawn on a set of axes normal x- and y- axes. 
The vertical position of the bar will indicate the depth, whereas the length
will indicate the margin of uncertainty related to depth (i.e. earthquake depth error.)
It is also envisioned to possibly map the earthquake magnitude as colour.

### Concept 3:

The final concept is a traditional grouped bar chart that shows the 
earhquake frequency vs. magnitude for earthquakes over the past 4 weeks (1 month).
Categorical colour mapping would be used to indicate which period each bar belongs to.
